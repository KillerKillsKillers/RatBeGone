# RatBeGone
This mod prevents you from loading your game if your mods folder contains a RAT(Remote access trojain) this makes it so you cannot get hacked or have your stuff stolen. This mod is made for the hypixel skyblock playerbase as ratting is a frequent thing on skyblock though this mod can be used univerally on 1.8.9. While im sure this won't end ratting atleast some people can be protected from it!

**INFO:**
  - **HOW IT WORKS:** This mod will go through and decompile all other mods in your mods folder looking for malicious code. If found you will have the option to allow the mod through, delete the mod, or crash your game and you can remove it yourself.
  
  - **FALSE FLAGS:** While it is possible for this mod to have false flags as mods like Skytils have code that looks malicious to verify you there is a way around it detecting mods you know are safe. After loading this mod for the first time a folder will appear in your .minecraft named 'Rat-Be-Gone' Inside of this folder is a file named config.yml. In this file you can copy a mods name such as Skytils(make sure you have the exact name of the mod EX: 'Skytils-1.7.3.jar') there will be preset examples and an in-depth explanation in the file to make this very simple for you. After adding a mod into the whitelist config it will no longer get flagged. If a mod is a flagged that you just downloaded or don't trust I recomend deleting it.
  
  - **IS THIS MOD ACCURATE:** In short yes, this will prevent you from getting ratted but if you are getting false flags from mods such as skytils please read the previous not on 'false flags'
  
  - **HOW TO AVOID DOWNLOADING MALICIOUS CODE/MODS:** The best way to avoid malicious mods/code is by only downloading a mod if it is from a trusted LINK such as CurseForge or Github as these websites do not allow malicious code to be posted and will ban any mod creator who tries. Do not download direct .jar mods from discord unless you trust the person who sent you the mod. Even if you do trust this person still be wary as they may lie to you.
